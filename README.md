# Description
This project contains a list of python scripts that read a certain CSV generated from google form's submissions (the csv is not in the project due to data protection) and generates PDF's with util data for logistics and administration of a Church Event. <br> 
It will be a event for Kids, so, the teachers need to see the relation of kids by age range, which kid's has allergy to some types of foods, and some more information that my scripts generate automatticaly.
