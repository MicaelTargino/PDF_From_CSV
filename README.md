# Description
This project contains a list of python scripts that read a certain CSV generated from google form's submissions (the csv and pdf are not in the repository due to data protection) and generates PDF's with util data for logistics and administration of a Church Event. <br> 
It will be a event for Kids, so, the teachers needed some information that my scripts generate automatticaly, Like:

-  List of kids grouped by age range
-  Util info for kid management (parents names and phones)
-  List of kid's who has allergy to some types of foods
-  a frequency pdf to keep track how many days each kid went to the event

# What I learned

# Conclusion
